## Overview 
This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks which demonstrate simple linear regression models for predicting salaries based on years of experience and delivery times based on sorting times. Below you will find the descriptions of the datasets used and the libraries required to run the notebooks.

## Datasets
## Salary Dataset
This dataset contains information on individual salaries relative to their years of experience. It is used to establish a relationship between how many years an individual has worked and their corresponding earnings. This can be useful for predicting future salaries based on experience.
Columns:
- YearsExperience: The number of years an individual has worked.
- Salary: The annual salary of the individual in US dollars.
## Delivery Time Dataset
This dataset examines the time required to deliver products in relation to the number of items sorted. The purpose is to predict the delivery time needed based on the sorting time, which can optimize logistics and delivery processes.
Columns:
- Delivery Time: The time it takes to deliver products (in minutes).
- Sorting Time: The time spent sorting the products before delivery (in minutes).
  
## Libraries Used
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- NumPy: For numerical operations.
- Seaborn: For statistical data visualization.
- Statsmodels: For building and analyzing statistical models.
- Matplotlib: (implicitly used by Seaborn) for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations in Python.
